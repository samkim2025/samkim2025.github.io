    <h1>CS180 Fun with Filters and Frequencies! </h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Finite Difference Operator</h3>
    
    <p>In this part of the project, I used finite difference operators to compute the partial derivatives of the "cameraman" image (shown below) in the x and y directions.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <h3>Original Cameraman</h3>
        <img src="media/Original Image.png" alt="Cameraman">
    </div>
    
    <p>These derivatives help understand how pixel values change along these axes, which is critical for edge detection..</p>

     <div class="image-container">
        <h3>Ix</h3>
        <p>Applying the finite difference operator [-1, 1] along the x axis allows us to compute the derivative in x to highlight vertical edges.</p>

    </div>

     <div class="image-container">
        <h3>Iy</h3>
         <p>Similarly, I applied the finite difference operator along the y axis to compute the derivative in y to highlight horizontal edges.</p>
        <img src="media/Iy (Derivative in y).png" alt="Iy Cameraman">
    </div>
    
    <p>I initially divided the image into three, each representing the blue, green, and red channels respectively (from top to bottom).</p>
    <p>After dividing them, I sought to align them and produce a color photograph.</p>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>First, I tried to see what would happen if I just divided the image in thirds, and stack them on top of each other.</p>
    <p>The result is depicted below, and it's not pretty.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
        <h3>Simple Stack Cathedral</h3>
        <img src="media/simple_stacked_cathedral.jpg" alt="Simple Stack Cathedral">
    </div>

    <p>Seeing that approach fail, I sought a different approach. </p>
    <p>First, I used the circular_shift function to align the channels. This method shifts an image by a given offset along the vertical and horizontal axes, and enables us to test different alignments.</p>
    <p>To measure the alignment quality quantitatively, I used the compute_ssd function to calculate sum of squared differences between the reference channel and the shifted target channel. Lower SSD values imply better alignment. </p>
    <p>Then, I use the align_channels method to carry out a brute-fore search over a given range of shifts performed on the target channel. For every shift in this range, I calculate the SSD, and eventually choose the shift with the lowest SSD value. </p>
    <p>For large images (i.e. the .tif files), a brute force becomes super expensive and would take a long time to run. To address this, I implemented the pyramid_align method. In this method, we create an image pyramid that is made up of progressively smaller images, each downsampled from the previous one by a factor of 2. The pyramid method aligns the images at the smallest scale, where the search space is minimal. I then refine this shift at higher resolutions by upscaling the shift.</p>
    <p>To build this image pyramid manually, I've written the manual_downsample and manual_upsample methods, which decreases/increases the image size. </p>
    <p>Finally, the proess_image method carries out this entire process. It reads the image, divides it into three channels, and crops each channel to remove edges (default factor of 5%). The green and red channels are aligned to the blue channel using the pyramid alignment method. Finally, I stack these aligned channels to form the output image, which is saved and displayed.</p>

        <p>Unlike the other images, it was difficult to align the Emirs. This was because there were significant brightness differences across the channels. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">
        <h3>Emir (original)</h3>
        <img src="media/emir2.jpg" alt="Unaligned Emir">
        <p>As you can see here, the darkness/brightness of the Emir's cloak varies greatly across the channels. In the top-most chanel, the Emir's cloak is very bright (white). In the bottom-most channel, the cloak is very dark (almost black). This difference made it difficult to apply the algorithm nicely. </p>
